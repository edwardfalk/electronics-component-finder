# Electronics Component Finder - Project Status

## Project Overview
The Electronics Component Finder is a web application that allows users to search for electronic components across multiple online shops. It provides a unified interface to compare prices, check stock availability, and find datasheets for various electronic components.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features
- Basic project structure with TypeScript, Express, and SQLite
- Component search functionality with mock data
- Shop service for fetching component data (currently using mock data)
- Component controller for handling API requests
- Express routes for component endpoints
- Frontend UI with search functionality
- Simple test page for verifying JavaScript functionality
- User profile system with OneDrive integration
- MCP server migration to OneDrive for cross-device availability

### In Progress
- Database implementation for caching search results
- Integration with actual shop APIs
- Parts list management

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Knowledge Graph Memory Integration**
   - Installation of Knowledge Graph Memory MCP server from marketplace
   - Schema design for component relationships
   - Component cross-reference system
   - Contextual understanding of component usage
   - Integration with Cline's memory for persistent context

2. **External Resource Connector MCP Server**
   - Integration with component supplier APIs (Mouser, Digikey, LCSC, etc.)
   - Unified search interface across multiple suppliers
   - Component availability tracking
   - Price comparison functionality
   - Datasheet retrieval and caching

3. **Project Context MCP Server**
   - Codebase indexing and understanding
   - Component relationship tracking
   - Supplier and pricing pattern analysis

4. **Documentation Aggregator**
   - Component datasheet organization
   - Specification linking and comparison
   - Component selection decision tracking
   - Alternative component suggestions

5. **Visual Interface Improvements**
   - Component search result visualization
   - UI state tracking during search and filter
   - Enhanced user interaction with component browser

6. **User Preference System**
   - Saved favorite components and suppliers
   - Personalized search results
   - User-specific parts lists

### Technical Details
- Backend: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- Database: SQLite for local storage and caching
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- MCP Servers: Custom servers for extended functionality
- Knowledge Graph: For component relationships and context

## Known Issues
1. **Checkpoint Issue**: The project was moved from its original location (`c:\Users\edwar\Documents\PlatformIO\Projects\bil_test2`) to the current location, causing checkpoint functionality to break. A workspace file has been created to fix this issue.

2. **OneDrive Sync Issues**: The project is currently located in an OneDrive folder, which may cause issues with file watching and development server stability.

## Next Steps
1. Open the newly created workspace file (`electronics-component-finder.code-workspace`) in VSCode
2. ✅ Install the Knowledge Graph Memory MCP server
3. ✅ Implement the Qdrant MCP server for semantic search
4. ✅ Implement the Obsidian MCP server for documentation
5. ✅ Implement the Component API Server for supplier API integration
6. Complete the database implementation for caching
7. Enhance the frontend UI with more features
8. Add authentication for user-specific parts lists

## Implementation Plan for Next Session
1. **✅ Install Knowledge Graph Memory MCP Server**
   - ✅ Created custom Knowledge Graph Memory MCP server
   - ✅ Configured for both component relationships and Cline memory
   - ✅ Designed schema for electronic components and conversation context
   - ✅ Set up integration with user profile system

2. **✅ Implement Qdrant MCP Server for Semantic Search**
   - ✅ Created custom Qdrant MCP server for vector search
   - ✅ Implemented component indexing with vector embeddings
   - ✅ Added semantic search capabilities using natural language
   - ✅ Provided tools for finding similar components
   - ✅ Integrated with MCP settings

3. **✅ Implement Obsidian MCP Server for Documentation**
   - ✅ Created custom Obsidian MCP server for Markdown notes
   - ✅ Implemented note access and search capabilities
   - ✅ Added backlink exploration for knowledge graph navigation
   - ✅ Provided tools for creating and managing documentation
   - ✅ Integrated with MCP settings

4. **✅ Implement Component API Server**
   - ✅ Created custom Component API Server for supplier integration
   - ✅ Implemented unified data model for component information
   - ✅ Added tools for searching, retrieving, and comparing components
   - ✅ Implemented caching for improved performance
   - ✅ Added support for multiple suppliers (Mouser, Digikey, LCSC, Arrow)
   - ✅ Integrated with MCP settings

3. **Integrate Systems**
   - Connect the Knowledge Graph Memory with the Component API Server
   - Develop schema for storing component relationships
   - Create memory structures for maintaining conversation context
   - Implement querying capabilities for both systems
